 Hello hello hello! Iâ€™m Caroline (<a href="http://www.github.com/carolinejdale">@carolinejdale</a>).
- Iâ€™ve been making websites since I was little, but it's only recently I've started looking at it as a possible career path.
- I'm interested in working out what I'm interested in.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how much I don't know (less than I feared; more than I imagined). I'm currently focusing on learning JavaScript and chugging through the <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a> syllabus while putting together a portfolio of my front-end projects, but my plan is to slowly work my way further down the stack.
- I have a tragic penchant for early web nostalgia (especially TEEN GIRLS WITH WHIMSICAL DOMAIN NAMES CULTURE circa 1999). 
- I like dancing, sewing clothes, history, singing, writing, solving puzzles, black and white illustration, listening to comedy podcasts, playing folk songs on the autoharp, Sudoku, pink stationery, tall ships, going to the ballet, liquid timers, dusty theatres, Dolly Parton, wearing chic little capes and hats, drag shows, house parties, Edward Gorey, fountain pens on Clairefontaine paper, textile recycling, coming-of-age stories about clever young women, Daniel Day Lewis, matcha, glitter, the usual.
