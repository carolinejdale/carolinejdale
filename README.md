Hello hello hello! Iâ€™m Caroline (<a href="http://www.github.com/carolinejdale">@carolinejdale</a>).

I like to make things on the internet.

I'm interested in early web nostalgia, monospace fonts, interrogating trends, DIY culture, plain text, chaos, kitsch, camp, minimum viable products, and maximalism.

Other things I like are dancing, sewing clothes, Grand Romance, history, singing, writing, solving puzzles, black and white illustration, listening to comedy podcasts, playing folk songs on the autoharp, Sudoku, pink stationery, tall ships, going to the ballet, liquid timers, dusty theatres, Dolly Parton, wearing chic little capes and hats, drag shows, house parties, Edward Gorey, fountain pens on Clairefontaine paper, textile recycling, coming-of-age stories about clever young women, Daniel Day-Lewis, matcha, biodegradable glitter, the usual.
